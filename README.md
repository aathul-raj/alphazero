# alphazero

an alphazero implementation i worked on from the excellent course by freeCodeCamp. can't recommend that course enough, such an intuitive explanation on MCTS and the value/policy networks behind the alphazero algorithm. it can play tictactoe at a superhuman level after training, which takes quite a while.

taught me about mcts, resnet, value networks, policy networks, and served as an excellent intro to reinforcment learning. originally i worked on this because i taught this approach would work for an RL system that could play pokemon showdown. that project is on hold for the moment though - i'll get around to it eventually.
